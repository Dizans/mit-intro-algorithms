All answers below are values, and not the number of the answer choice:


Problem 1

a: AVL tree
b: O(lg n)
c: O(lg n)
d: O(lg n)
e: Rank(h) - Rank(l) + 1
f: Rank(h) - Rank(l)
g: Rank(h) - Rank(l)
h: Rank(h) - Rank(l) - 1
i: Number of nodes in subtree
j: O(n) bits
k: 1
l: 3
m: 6
n: 10
o: Insert, Delete, Rotate-Left, Rotate-Right,
p: O(lg n)
q: Lowest Common Ancestor
r: O(log n)
s: O(lg L)
t:

LCA determines the lowest node in the tree such that l and h are reachable
from that node. When the loop is initialized, node is the root of the tree,
and so all nodes in the tree are reachable. The exit condition is when low is
less than or equal to the node and high is greater than or equal to the node.
When l is less than or equal to the node, it is to the left of the node, and
when h is greater than or equal to the node, it is to the right. Therefore,
when both of these conditions are true, node is the lowest common node, because
movement to the left or right would exclude one of the boundaries.
Assuming l <= h, if both of the conditions are not true, one of them is true,
and the next node will be chosen in the direction so that it remains true.
Assume, without loss of generality, that h is greater than node, but l is not
less than or equal to node. This means that l must be greater than node, and
so the next node is chosen as node.right. The immediate right child roots
a subtree that must include both l and h, because it only excludes values
less than or equal to the (previous) node. Proceeding in this manner,
eventually l will be in the left subtree of node and h in the right.
This is because l is less than h, and so it will be passed first. At this point,
node will be the lowest common ancestor of the the two boundaries.

Problem 2

a: intersects(self, other_wire)
b: 187590314
c: the x-coordinates where vertical and horizontal wires intersect
d: the wire is added to the range index
e: the wire is removed from the range index
f: nothing happens
g: a range index query is performed
h: the range index holds all wires 'stabbed' by the sweep line
i: the x-coordinate that will remove it from the index
j: _add_intersections
k: 49432
l: Implemented a red-black tree
